"How do you get to be a great musician? It helps to know the theory, and to understand the mechanics of your instrument. 
It helps to have talent. But ultimately, greatness comes from practicing; applying the theory over and over again, using feedback to get better every time."

This repository presents my solved tasks. Most of the tasks can be found on the website: www.codewars.com/
I sincerely encourage you to solve algorithmic tasks in order to improve your programming skills.
